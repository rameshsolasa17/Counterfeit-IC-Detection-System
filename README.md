# Counterfeit-IC-Detection-System
The infiltration of counterfeit electronic compo
nents into the global supply chain poses a critical threat to
 the security of critical infrastructures. This article addresses
 the challenge of identifying such counterfeit products, in
cluding recycled, branded, overproduced, cloned, damaged
 and tampered electronic parts. Using optical imaging, a fast
 and inexpensive physical inspection method, we propose a
 machine learning-based framework to detect counterfeit in
tegrated circuits (ICs). The framework uses image processing
 and computer vision techniques to access two categories:
 authentic and fake datasets. After training, the model can
 estimate the authenticity of new, unstamped IC images. This
 study describes the development, training, and validation
 processes of an identification system and investigates its
 effectiveness in improving the traceability and reliability of
 electronic components in critical infrastructures.
